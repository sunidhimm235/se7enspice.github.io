            <p class="p">It all started way back when I decided to go to Canada. During my training Hyatt Regency Ahmedabad, I had it in my mind that I'm going to open my small outlet no matter the cost! I had an amazing journey at Hyatt Regency because of this one
                chef who taught me the basics of kitchen as well as the Indian cuisine ! He very well taught me about the curries and the different spices used in Indian cooking. From that I came up with the idea of my little outlet which I was gonna
                open and that is "SEVEN SPICES". All because I use secret seven spices in my curries. Also during my training I found out that hygiene is the most important factor while cooking food so it always stays on top of my list! Moreover my plans
                got changed due to this deadly corona virus and again the safety of the people whom I feed is really important, so I came up with an idea to cook delicious food, served with utmost hygiene practices!</p>
